## what is this?
## whenever a lease is made, the script runs and logs the "hostname" of the device

## ip dhcp-server lease-script
:if ($leaseBound = "1") do={
	:log info ($leaseServerName . " assigned " . $leaseActIP . " to " . $leaseActMAC . " (" . ([/ip dhcp-server lease get [find active-address=$leaseActIP] host-name]) . ")" )
}
